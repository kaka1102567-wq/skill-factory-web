 Audience 

 Reach the people who want to hear from you. 

 You decide who sees your ad and where. Create the online audience based on the traits of who you want to see your ad, and narrow down your ad’s audience by interests, gender or location and use ad targeting to find the people most likely to take action. Once your ad starts running, our system will learn who is engaging with it and, over time, narrow your audience so you reach more of the right people. 

 Define your target audience 

 Think about characteristics that your current customers have in common, such as demographics, location and interests. Then, broaden or narrow that audience based on your population size. 

Build and refine your audience.

 1. Create an audience 

 As you create your target online audience, keep an eye on the audience meter, which will let you know whether your audience is too specific, too broad or just right. 

 2. Start Broad 

 Our ad delivery system works best when your audience size is between 2 to 10 million people. With a bigger audience, the auction will have greater opportunities to deliver ads, observe outcomes and optimize. Consider location, age and gender of the customers you want to see your ads. 

 3. Add more details 

 Using detailed targeting like adding ‘interest’ targeting may lead to smaller audiences, but it may also help better target your ads to an audience more likely to respond to your ads. We recommend using interest targeting only if your audience is at least 2 million people. 

 Who do you want to connect with during your next campaign?
