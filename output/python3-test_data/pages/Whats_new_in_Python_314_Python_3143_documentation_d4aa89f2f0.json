  "content": "Adam Turner and Hugo van Kemenade\n\nThis article explains the new features in Python 3.14, compared to 3.13. Python 3.14 was released on 7 October 2025. For full details, see the changelog.\n\nPEP 745 – Python 3.14 release schedule\n\nPython 3.14 is the latest stable release of the Python programming language, with a mix of changes to the language, the implementation, and the standard library. The biggest changes include template string literals, deferred evaluation of annotations, and support for subinterpreters in the standard library.\n\nThe library changes include significantly improved capabilities for introspection in asyncio, support for Zstandard via a new compression.zstd module, syntax highlighting in the REPL, as well as the usual deprecations and removals, and improvements in user-friendliness and correctness.\n\nThis article doesn’t attempt to provide a complete specification of all new features, but instead gives a convenient overview. For full details refer to the documentation, such as the Library Reference and Language Reference. To understand the complete implementation and design rationale for a change, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature; but note that PEPs usually are not kept up-to-date once a feature has been fully implemented. See Porting to Python 3.14 for guidance on upgrading from earlier versions of Python.\n\nInterpreter improvements:\n\nPEP 649 and PEP 749: Deferred evaluation of annotations\n\nPEP 734: Multiple interpreters in the standard library\n\nPEP 750: Template strings\n\nPEP 758: Allow except and except* expressions without brackets\n\nPEP 765: Control flow in finally blocks\n\nPEP 768: Safe external debugger interface for CPython\n\nA new type of interpreter\n\nFree-threaded mode improvements\n\nImproved error messages\n\nIncremental garbage collection\n\nSignificant improvements in the standard library:\n\nPEP 784: Zstandard support in the standard library\n\nAsyncio introspection capabilities\n\nConcurrent safe warnings control\n\nSyntax highlighting in the default interactive shell, and color output in several standard library CLIs\n\nPEP 741: Python configuration C API\n\nPEP 776: Emscripten is now an officially supported platform, at tier 3.\n\nPEP 779: Free-threaded Python is officially supported\n\nPEP 761: PGP signatures have been discontinued for official releases\n\nWindows and macOS binary releases now support the experimental just-in-time compiler\n\nBinary releases for Android are now provided\n\nThe annotations on functions, classes, and modules are no longer evaluated eagerly. Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose annotate functions and evaluated only when necessary (except if from __future__ import annotations is used).\n\nThis change is designed to improve performance and usability of annotations in Python in most circumstances. The runtime cost for defining annotations is minimized, but it remains possible to introspect annotations at runtime. It is no longer necessary to enclose annotations in strings if they contain forward references.\n\nThe new annotationlib module provides tools for inspecting deferred annotations. Annotations may be evaluated in the VALUE format (which evaluates annotations to runtime values, similar to the behavior in earlier Python versions), the FORWARDREF format (which replaces undefined names with special markers), and the STRING format (which returns annotations as strings).\n\nThis example shows how these formats behave:\n\nThe porting section contains guidance on changes that may be needed due to these changes, though in the majority of cases, code will continue working as-is.\n\n(Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in PEP 749 and gh-119180; PEP 649 was written by Larry Hastings.)\n\nDeferred Evaluation Of Annotations Using Descriptors\n\nThe CPython runtime supports running multiple copies of Python in the same process simultaneously and has done so for over 20 years. Each of these separate copies is called an ‘interpreter’. However, the feature had been available only through the C-API.\n\nThat limitation is removed in Python 3.14, with the new concurrent.interpreters module.\n\nThere are at least two notable reasons why using multiple interpreters has significant benefits:\n\nthey support a new (to Python), human-friendly concurrency model\n\ntrue multi-core parallelism\n\nFor some use cases, concurrency in software improves efficiency and can simplify design, at a high level. At the same time, implementing and maintaining all but the simplest concurrency is often a struggle for the human brain. That especially applies to plain threads (for example, threading), where all memory is shared between all threads.\n\nWith multiple isolated interpreters, you can take advantage of a class of concurrency models, like Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP) or the actor model, that have found success in other programming languages, like Smalltalk, Erlang, Haskell, and Go. Think of multiple interpreters as threads but with opt-in sharing.\n\nRegarding multi-core parallelism: as of Python 3.12, interpreters are now sufficiently isolated from one another to be used in parallel (see PEP 684). This unlocks a variety of CPU-intensive use cases for Python that were limited by the GIL.\n\nUsing multiple interpreters is similar in many ways to multiprocessing, in that they both provide isolated logical “processes” that can run in parallel, with no sharing by default. However, when using multiple interpreters, an application will use fewer system resources and will operate more efficiently (since it stays within the same process). Think of multiple interpreters as having the isolation of processes with the efficiency of threads.\n\nWhile the feature has been around for decades, multiple interpreters have not been used widely, due to low awareness and the lack of a standard library module. Consequently, they currently have several notable limitations, which are expected to improve significantly now that the feature is going mainstream.\n\nstarting each interpreter has not been optimized yet\n\neach interpreter uses more memory than necessary (work continues on extensive internal sharing between interpreters)\n\nthere aren’t many options yet for truly sharing objects or other data between interpreters (other than memoryview)\n\nmany third-party extension modules on PyPI are not yet compatible with multiple interpreters (all standard library extension modules are compatible)\n\nthe approach to writing applications that use multiple isolated interpreters is mostly unfamiliar to Python users, for now\n\nThe impact of these limitations will depend on future CPython improvements, how interpreters are used, and what the community solves through PyPI packages. Depending on the use case, the limitations may not have much impact, so try it out!\n\nFurthermore, future CPython releases will reduce or eliminate overhead and provide utilities that are less appropriate on PyPI. In the meantime, most of the limitations can also be addressed through extension modules, meaning PyPI packages can fill any gap for 3.14, and even back to 3.12 where interpreters were finally properly isolated and stopped sharing the GIL. Likewise, libraries on PyPI are expected to emerge for high-level abstractions on top of interpreters.\n\nRegarding extension modules, work is in progress to update some PyPI projects, as well as tools like Cython, pybind11, nanobind, and PyO3. The steps for isolating an extension module are found at Isolating Extension Modules. Isolating a module has a lot of overlap with what is required to support free-threading, so the ongoing work in the community in that area will help accelerate support for multiple interpreters.\n\nAlso added in 3.14: concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor.\n\n(Contributed by Eric Snow in gh-134939.)\n\nTemplate strings are a new mechanism for custom string processing. They share the familiar syntax of f-strings but, unlike f-strings, return an object representing the static and interpolated parts of the string, instead of a simple str.\n\nTo write a t-string, use a 't' prefix instead of an 'f':\n\nTemplate objects provide access to the static and interpolated (in curly braces) parts of a string before they are combined. Iterate over Template instances to access their parts in order:\n\nIt’s easy to write (or call) code to process Template instances. For example, here’s a function that renders static parts lowercase and Interpolation instances uppercase:\n\nBecause Template instances distinguish between static strings and interpolations at runtime, they can be useful for sanitising user input. Writing a html() function that escapes user input in HTML is an exercise left to the reader! Template processing code can provide improved flexibility. For instance, a more advanced html() function could accept a dict of HTML attributes directly in the template:\n\nOf course, template processing code does not need to return a string-like result. An even more advanced html() could return a custom type representing a DOM-like structure.\n\nWith t-strings in place, developers can write systems that sanitise SQL, make safe shell operations, improve logging, tackle modern ideas in web development (HTML, CSS, and so on), and implement lightweight custom business DSLs.\n\n(Contributed by Jim Baker, Guido van Rossum, Paul Everitt, Koudai Aono, Lysandros Nikolaou, Dave Peck, Adam Turner, Jelle Zijlstra, Bénédikt Tran, and Pablo Galindo Salgado in gh-132661.)\n\nPython 3.14 introduces a zero-overhead debugging interface that allows debuggers and profilers to safely attach to running Python processes without stopping or restarting them. This is a significant enhancement to Python’s debugging capabilities, meaning that unsafe alternatives are no longer required.\n\nThe new interface provides safe execution points for attaching debugger code without modifying the interpreter’s normal execution path or adding any overhead at runtime. Due to this, tools can now inspect and interact with Python applications in real-time, which is a crucial capability for high-availability systems and production environments.\n\nFor convenience, this interface is implemented in the sys.remote_exec() function. For example:\n\nThis function allows sending Python code to be executed in a target process at the next safe execution point. However, tool authors can also implement the protocol directly as described in the PEP, which details the underlying mechanisms used to safely attach to running processes.\n\nThe debugging interface has been carefully designed with security in mind and includes several mechanisms to control access:\n\nA PYTHON_DISABLE_REMOTE_DEBUG environment variable.\n\nA -X disable-remote-debug command-line option.\n\nA --without-remote-debug configure flag to completely disable the feature at build time.\n\n(Contributed by Pablo Galindo Salgado, Matt Wozniski, and Ivona Stojanovic in gh-131591.)\n\nA new type of interpreter has been added to CPython. It uses tail calls between small C functions that implement individual Python opcodes, rather than one large C case statement. For certain newer compilers, this interpreter provides significantly better performance. Preliminary benchmarks suggest a geometric mean of 3-5% faster on the standard pyperformance benchmark suite, depending on platform and architecture. The baseline is Python 3.14 built with Clang 19, without this new interpreter.\n\nThis interpreter currently only works with Clang 19 and newer on x86-64 and AArch64 architectures. However, a future release of GCC is expected to support this as well.\n\nThis feature is opt-in for now. Enabling profile-guided optimization is highly recommendeded when using the new interpreter as it is the only configuration that has been tested and validated for improved performance. For further information, see --with-tail-call-interp.\n\nThis is not to be confused with tail call optimization of Python functions, which is currently not implemented in CPython.\n\nThis new interpreter type is an internal implementation detail of the CPython interpreter. It doesn’t change the visible behavior of Python programs at all. It can improve their performance, but doesn’t change anything else.\n\n(Contributed by Ken Jin in gh-128563, with ideas on how to implement this in CPython by Mark Shannon, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman.)\n\nCPython’s free-threaded mode (PEP 703), initially added in 3.13, has been significantly improved in Python 3.14. The implementation described in PEP 703 has been finished, including C API changes, and temporary workarounds in the interpreter were replaced with more permanent solutions. The specializing adaptive interpreter (PEP 659) is now enabled in free-threaded mode, which along with many other optimizations greatly improves its performance. The performance penalty on single-threaded code in free-threaded mode is now roughly 5-10%, depending on the platform and C compiler used.\n\nFrom Python 3.14, when compiling extension modules for the free-threaded build of CPython on Windows, the preprocessor variable Py_GIL_DISABLED now needs to be specified by the build backend, as it will no longer be determined automatically by the C compiler. For a running interpreter, the setting that was used at compile time can be found using sysconfig.get_config_var().\n\nThe new -X context_aware_warnings flag controls if concurrent safe warnings control is enabled. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.\n\nA new thread_inherit_context flag has been added, which if enabled means that threads created with threading.Thread start with a copy of the Context() of the caller of start(). Most significantly, this makes the warning filtering context established by catch_warnings be “inherited” by threads (or asyncio tasks) started within that context. It also affects other modules that use context variables, such as the decimal context manager. This flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.\n\n(Contributed by Sam Gross, Matt Page, Neil Schemenauer, Thomas Wouters, Donghee Na, Kirill Podoprigora, Ken Jin, Itamar Oren, Brett Simmers, Dino Viehland, Nathan Goldbaum, Ralf Gommers, Lysandros Nikolaou, Kumar Aditya, Edgar Margffoy, and many others. Some of these contributors are employed by Meta, which has continued to provide significant engineering resources to support this project.)\n\nThe interpreter now provides helpful suggestions when it detects typos in Python keywords. When a word that closely resembles a Python keyword is encountered, the interpreter will suggest the correct keyword in the error message. This feature helps programmers quickly identify and fix common typing mistakes. For example:\n\nWhile the feature focuses on the most common cases, some variations of misspellings may still result in regular syntax errors. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in gh-132449.)\n\nelif statements that follow an else block now have a specific error message. (Contributed by Steele Farnsworth in gh-129902.)\n\nIf a statement is passed to the Conditional expressions after else, or one of pass, break, or continue is passed before if, then the error message highlights where the expression is required. (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in gh-129515.)\n\nWhen incorrectly closed strings are detected, the error message suggests that the string may be intended to be part of the string. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in gh-88535.)\n\nWhen strings have incompatible prefixes, the error now shows which prefixes are incompatible. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-133197.)\n\nImproved error messages when using as with incompatible targets in:\n\nImports: import ... as ...\n\nFrom imports: from ... import ... as ...\n\nExcept handlers: except ... as ...\n\nPattern-match cases: case ... as ...\n\n(Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-123539, gh-123562, and gh-123440.)\n\nImproved error message when trying to add an instance of an unhashable type to a dict or set. (Contributed by CF Bolz-Tereick and Victor Stinner in gh-132828.)\n\nImproved error message when an object supporting the synchronous context manager protocol is entered using async with instead of with, and vice versa for the asynchronous context manager protocol. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-128398.)\n\nThe new compression package contains modules compression.lzma, compression.bz2, compression.gzip and compression.zlib which re-export the lzma, bz2, gzip and zlib modules respectively. The new import names under compression are the preferred names for importing these compression modules from Python 3.14. However, the existing modules names have not been deprecated. Any deprecation or removal of the existing compression modules will occur no sooner than five years after the release of 3.14.\n\nThe new compression.zstd module provides compression and decompression APIs for the Zstandard format via bindings to Meta’s zstd library. Zstandard is a widely adopted, highly efficient, and fast compression format. In addition to the APIs introduced in compression.zstd, support for reading and writing Zstandard compressed archives has been added to the tarfile, zipfile, and shutil modules.\n\nHere’s an example of using the new module to compress some data:\n\nAs can be seen, the API is similar to the APIs of the lzma and bz2 modules.\n\n(Contributed by Emma Harper Smith, Adam Turner, Gregory P. Smith, Tomas Roun, Victor Stinner, and Rogdham in gh-132983.)\n\nAdded a new command-line interface to inspect running Python processes using asynchronous tasks, available via python -m asyncio ps PID or python -m asyncio pstree PID.\n\nThe ps subcommand inspects the given process ID (PID) and displays information about currently running asyncio tasks. It outputs a task table: a flat listing of all tasks, their names, their coroutine stacks, and which tasks are awaiting them.\n\nThe pstree subcommand fetches the same information, but instead renders a visual async call tree, showing coroutine relationships in a hierarchical format. This command is particularly useful for debugging long-running or stuck asynchronous programs. It can help developers quickly identify where a program is blocked, what tasks are pending, and how coroutines are chained together.\n\nFor example given this code:\n\nExecuting the new tool on the running process will yield a table like this:\n\nIf a cycle is detected in the async await graph (which could indicate a programming issue), the tool raises an error and lists the cycle paths that prevent tree construction:\n\n(Contributed by Pablo Galindo, Łukasz Langa, Yury Selivanov, and Marta Gomez Macias in gh-91048.)\n\nThe warnings.catch_warnings context manager will now optionally use a context variable for warning filters. This is enabled by setting the context_aware_warnings flag, either with the -X command-line option or an environment variable. This gives predictable warnings control when using catch_warnings combined with multiple threads or asynchronous tasks. The flag defaults to true for the free-threaded build and false for the GIL-enabled build.\n\n(Contributed by Neil Schemenauer and Kumar Aditya in gh-130010.)\n\nAll Windows code pages are now supported as ‘cpXXX’ codecs on Windows. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-123803.)\n\nImplement mixed-mode arithmetic rules combining real and complex numbers as specified by the C standard since C99. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-69639.)\n\nMore syntax errors are now detected regardless of optimisation and the -O command-line option. This includes writes to __debug__, incorrect use of await, and asynchronous comprehensions outside asynchronous functions. For example, python -O -c 'assert (__debug__ := 1)' or python -O -c 'assert await 1' now produce SyntaxErrors. (Contributed by Irit Katriel and Jelle Zijlstra in gh-122245 & gh-121637.)\n\nWhen subclassing a pure C type, the C slots for the new type are no longer replaced with a wrapped version on class creation if they are not explicitly overridden in the subclass. (Contributed by Tomasz Pytel in gh-132284.)\n\nThe bytes.fromhex() and bytearray.fromhex() methods now accept ASCII bytes and bytes-like objects. (Contributed by Daniel Pope in gh-129349.)\n\nAdd class methods float.from_number() and complex.from_number() to convert a number to float or complex type correspondingly. They raise a TypeError if the argument is not a real number. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-84978.)\n\nSupport underscore and comma as thousands separators in the fractional part for floating-point presentation types of the new-style string formatting (with format() or f-strings). (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-87790.)\n\nThe int() function no longer delegates to __trunc__(). Classes that want to support conversion to int() must implement either __int__() or __index__(). (Contributed by Mark Dickinson in gh-119743.)\n\nThe map() function now has an optional keyword-only strict flag like zip() to check that all the iterables are of equal length. (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in gh-119793.)\n\nThe memoryview type now supports subscription, making it a generic type. (Contributed by Brian Schubert in gh-126012.)\n\nUsing NotImplemented in a boolean context will now raise a TypeError. This has raised a DeprecationWarning since Python 3.9. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-118767.)\n\nThree-argument pow() now tries calling __rpow__() if necessary. Previously it was only called in two-argument pow() and the binary power operator. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-130104.)\n\nsuper objects are now copyable and pickleable. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-125767.)\n\nThe import time flag can now track modules that are already loaded (‘cached’), via the new -X importtime=2. When such a module is imported, the self and cumulative times are replaced by the string cached.\n\nValues above 2 for -X importtime are now reserved for future use.\n\n(Contributed by Noah Kim and Adam Turner in gh-118655.)\n\nThe command-line option -c now automatically dedents its code argument before execution. The auto-dedentation behavior mirrors textwrap.dedent(). (Contributed by Jon Crall and Steven Sun in gh-103998.)\n\n-J is no longer a reserved flag for Jython, and now has no special meaning. (Contributed by Adam Turner in gh-133336.)\n\nThe except and except* expressions now allow brackets to be omitted when there are multiple exception types and the as clause is not used. For example:\n\n(Contributed by Pablo Galindo and Brett Cannon in PEP 758 and gh-131831.)\n\nThe compiler now emits a SyntaxWarning when a return, break, or continue statement have the effect of leaving a finally block. This change is specified in PEP 765.\n\nIn situations where this change is inconvenient (such as those where the warnings are redundant due to code linting), the warning filter can be used to turn off all syntax warnings by adding ignore::SyntaxWarning as a filter. This can be specified in combination with a filter that converts other warnings to errors (for example, passing -Werror -Wignore::SyntaxWarning as CLI options, or setting PYTHONWARNINGS=error,ignore::SyntaxWarning).\n\nNote that applying such a filter at runtime using the warnings module will only suppress the warning in code that is compiled after the filter is adjusted. Code that is compiled prior to the filter adjustment (for example, when a module is imported) will still emit the syntax warning.\n\n(Contributed by Irit Katriel in gh-130080.)\n\nThe cycle garbage collector is now incremental. This means that maximum pause times are reduced by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.\n\nThere are now only two generations: young and old. When gc.collect() is not called directly, the GC is invoked a little less frequently. When invoked, it collects the young generation and an increment of the old generation, instead of collecting one or more generations.\n\nThe behavior of gc.collect() changes slightly:\n\ngc.collect(1): Performs an increment of garbage collection, rather than collecting generation 1.\n\nOther calls to gc.collect() are unchanged.\n\n(Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-108362.)\n\nThe default interactive shell now highlights Python syntax. The feature is enabled by default, save if PYTHON_BASIC_REPL or any other environment variable that disables colour is set. See Controlling color for details.\n\nThe default color theme for syntax highlighting strives for good contrast and exclusively uses the 4-bit VGA standard ANSI color codes for maximum compatibility. The theme can be customized using an experimental API _colorize.set_theme(). This can be called interactively or in the PYTHONSTARTUP script. Note that this function has no stability guarantees, and may change or be removed.\n\n(Contributed by Łukasz Langa in gh-131507.)\n\nThe default interactive shell now supports import auto-completion. This means that typing import co and pressing <Tab> will suggest modules starting with co. Similarly, typing from concurrent import i will suggest submodules of concurrent starting with i. Note that autocompletion of module attributes is not currently supported. (Contributed by Tomas Roun in gh-69605.)\n\nannotationlib: For introspecting annotations. See PEP 749 for more details. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-119180.)\n\ncompression (including compression.zstd): A package for compression-related modules, including a new module to support the Zstandard compression format. See PEP 784 for more details. (Contributed by Emma Harper Smith, Adam Turner, Gregory P. Smith, Tomas Roun, Victor Stinner, and Rogdham in gh-132983.)\n\nconcurrent.interpreters: Support for multiple interpreters in the standard library. See PEP 734 for more details. (Contributed by Eric Snow in gh-134939.)\n\nstring.templatelib: Support for template string literals (t-strings). See PEP 750 for more details. (Contributed by Jim Baker, Guido van Rossum, Paul Everitt, Koudai Aono, Lysandros Nikolaou, Dave Peck, Adam Turner, Jelle Zijlstra, Bénédikt Tran, and Pablo Galindo Salgado in gh-132661.)\n\nThe default value of the program name for argparse.ArgumentParser now reflects the way the Python interpreter was instructed to find the __main__ module code. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Alyssa Coghlan in gh-66436.)\n\nIntroduced the optional suggest_on_error parameter to argparse.ArgumentParser, enabling suggestions for argument choices and subparser names if mistyped by the user. (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in gh-124456.)\n\nEnable color for help text, which can be disabled with the optional color parameter to argparse.ArgumentParser. This can also be controlled by environment variables. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in gh-130645.)\n\nAdd compare(), a function for comparing two ASTs. (Contributed by Batuhan Taskaya and Jeremy Hylton in gh-60191.)\n\nAdd support for copy.replace() for AST nodes. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-121141.)\n\nDocstrings are now removed from an optimized AST in optimization level 2. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in gh-123958.)\n\nThe repr() output for AST nodes now includes more information. (Contributed by Tomas Roun in gh-116022.)\n\nWhen called with an AST as input, the parse() function now always verifies that the root node type is appropriate. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in gh-130139.)\n\nAdd new options to the command-line interface: --feature-version, --optimize, and --show-empty. (Contributed by Semyon Moroz in gh-133367.)\n\nThe function and methods named create_task() now take an arbitrary list of keyword arguments. All keyword arguments are passed to the Task constructor or the custom task factory. (See set_task_factory() for details.) The name and context keyword arguments are no longer special; the name should now be set using the name keyword argument of the factory, and context may be None.\n\nThis affects the following function and methods: asyncio.create_task(), asyncio.loop.create_task(), asyncio.TaskGroup.create_task().\n\n(Contributed by Thomas Grainger in gh-128307.)\n\nThere are two new utility functions for introspecting and printing a program’s call graph: capture_call_graph() and print_call_graph(). See Asyncio introspection capabilities for more details. (Contributed by Yury Selivanov, Pablo Galindo Salgado, and Łukasz Langa in gh-91048.)\n\nBy default, today’s date is highlighted in color in calendar’s command-line text output. This can be controlled by environment variables. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in gh-128317.)\n\nAdd a new executor class, InterpreterPoolExecutor, which exposes multiple Python interpreters in the same process (‘subinterpreters’) to Python code. This uses a pool of independent Python interpreters to execute calls asynchronously.\n\nThis is separate from the new interpreters module introduced by PEP 734. (Contributed by Eric Snow in gh-124548.)\n\nOn Unix platforms other than macOS, ‘forkserver’ is now the default start method for ProcessPoolExecutor (replacing ‘fork’). This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where ‘spawn’ remains the default start method.\n\nIf the threading incompatible fork method is required, you must explicitly request it by supplying a multiprocessing context mp_context to ProcessPoolExecutor.\n\nSee forkserver restrictions for information and differences with the fork method and how this change may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared objects that can not be automatically pickled.\n\n(Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in gh-84559.)\n\nAdd two new methods to ProcessPoolExecutor, terminate_workers() and kill_workers(), as ways to terminate or kill all living worker processes in the given pool. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in gh-130849.)\n\nAdd the optional buffersize parameter to Executor.map to limit the number of submitted tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If the buffer is full, iteration over the iterables pauses until a result is yielded from the buffer. (Contributed by Enzo Bonnal and Josh Rosenberg in gh-74028.)\n\nconfigparser will no longer write config files it cannot read, to improve security. Attempting to write() keys containing delimiters or beginning with the section header pattern will raise an InvalidWriteError. (Contributed by Jacob Lincoln in gh-129270.)\n\nSupport the context manager protocol for Token objects. (Contributed by Andrew Svetlov in gh-129889.)\n\nThe layout of bit fields in Structure and Union objects is now a closer match to platform defaults (GCC/Clang or MSVC). In particular, fields no longer overlap. (Contributed by Matthias Görgens in gh-97702.)\n\nThe Structure._layout_ class attribute can now be set to help match a non-default ABI. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in gh-97702.)\n\nThe class of Structure/Union field descriptors is now available as CField, and has new attributes to aid debugging and introspection. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in gh-128715.)\n\nOn Windows, the COMError exception is now public. (Contributed by Jun Komoda in gh-126686.)\n\nOn Windows, the CopyComPointer() function is now public. (Contributed by Jun Komoda in gh-127275.)\n\nAdd memoryview_at(), a function to create a memoryview object that refers to the supplied pointer and length. This works like ctypes.string_at() except it avoids a buffer copy, and is typically useful when implementing pure Python callback functions that are passed dynamically-sized buffers. (Contributed by Rian Hunter in gh-112018.)\n\nComplex types, c_float_complex, c_double_complex, and c_longdouble_complex, are now available if both the compiler and the libffi library support complex C types. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-61103.)\n\nAdd ctypes.util.dllist() for listing the shared libraries loaded by the current process. (Contributed by Brian Ward in gh-119349.)\n\nMove ctypes.POINTER() types cache from a global internal cache (_pointer_type_cache) to the _CData.__pointer_type__ attribute of the corresponding ctypes types. This will stop the cache from growing without limits in some situations. (Contributed by Sergey Miryanov in gh-100926.)\n\nThe py_object type now supports subscription, making it a generic type. (Contributed by Brian Schubert in gh-132168.)\n\nctypes now supports free-threading builds. (Contributed by Kumar Aditya and Peter Bierma in gh-127945.)\n\nAdd the assume_default_colors() function, a refinement of the use_default_colors() function which allows changing the color pair 0. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-133139.)\n\nAdd the strptime() method to the datetime.date and datetime.time classes. (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in gh-41431.)\n\nAdd Decimal.from_number() as an alternative constructor for Decimal. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-121798.)\n\nExpose IEEEContext() to support creation of contexts corresponding to the IEEE 754 (2008) decimal interchange formats. (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-53032.)\n\nComparison pages with highlighted changes generated by the HtmlDiff class now support ‘dark mode’. (Contributed by Jiahao Li in gh-129939.)\n\nAdd support for rendering full source location information of instructions, rather than only the line number. This feature is added to the following interfaces via the show_positions keyword argument:\n\nThis feature is also exposed via dis --show-positions. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-123165.)\n\nAdd the dis --specialized command-line option to show specialized bytecode. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-127413.)\n\nAdd the EHWPOISON error code constant. (Contributed by James Roy in gh-126585.)\n\nAdd support for printing the C stack trace on systems that support it via the new dump_c_stack() function or via the c_stack argument in faulthandler.enable(). (Contributed by Peter Bierma in gh-127604.)\n\nAdd filterfalse(), a function to reject names matching a given pattern. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-74598.)\n\nA Fraction object may now be constructed from any object with the as_integer_ratio() method. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-82017.)\n\nAdd Fraction.from_number() as an alternative constructor for Fraction. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-121797.)\n\nAdd the Placeholder sentinel. This may be used with the partial() or partialmethod() functions to reserve a place for positional arguments in the returned partial object. (Contributed by Dominykas Grigonis in gh-119127.)\n\nAllow the initial parameter of reduce() to be passed as a keyword argument. (Contributed by Sayandip Dutta in gh-125916.)\n\nAdd support for options with optional arguments. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-126374.)\n\nAdd support for returning intermixed options and non-option arguments in order. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-126390.)\n\nSupport keyboard feedback in the getpass() function via the keyword-only optional argument echo_char. Placeholder characters are rendered whenever a character is entered, and removed when a character is deleted. (Contributed by Semyon Moroz in gh-77065.)\n\nAllow TopologicalSorter.prepare() to be called more than once as long as sorting has not started. (Contributed by Daniel Pope in gh-130914.)\n\nThe heapq module has improved support for working with max-heaps, via the following new functions:\n\nAdd a built-in implementation for HMAC (RFC 2104) using formally verified code from the HACL* project. This implementation is used as a fallback when the OpenSSL implementation of HMAC is not available. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-99108.)\n\nDirectory lists and error pages generated by the http.server module allow the browser to apply its default dark mode. (Contributed by Yorik Hansen in gh-123430.)\n\nThe http.server module now supports serving over HTTPS using the http.server.HTTPSServer class. This functionality is exposed by the command-line interface (python -m http.server) through the following options:\n\n--tls-cert <path>: Path to the TLS certificate file.\n\n--tls-key <path>: Optional path to the private key file.\n\n--tls-password-file <path>: Optional path to the password file for the private key.\n\n(Contributed by Semyon Moroz in gh-85162.)\n\nAdd IMAP4.idle(), implementing the IMAP4 IDLE command as defined in RFC 2177. (Contributed by Forest in gh-55454.)\n\nsignature() takes a new argument annotation_format to control the annotationlib.Format used for representing annotations. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-101552.)\n\nSignature.format() takes a new argument unquote_annotations. If true, string annotations are displayed without surrounding quotes. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-101552.)\n\nAdd function ispackage() to determine whether an object is a package or not. (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in gh-125634.)\n\nReading text from a non-blocking stream with read may now raise a BlockingIOError if the operation cannot immediately return bytes. (Contributed by Giovanni Siragusa in gh-109523.)\n\nAdd the Reader and Writer protocols as simpler alternatives to the pseudo-protocols typing.IO, typing.TextIO, and typing.BinaryIO. (Contributed by Sebastian Rittau in gh-127648.)\n\nAdd exception notes for JSON serialization errors that allow identifying the source of the error. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-122163.)\n\nAllow using the json module as a script using the -m switch: python -m json. This is now preferred to python -m json.tool, which is soft deprecated. See the JSON command-line interface documentation. (Contributed by Trey Hunner in gh-122873.)\n\nBy default, the output of the JSON command-line interface is highlighted in color. This can be controlled by environment variables. (Contributed by Tomas Roun in gh-131952.)\n\ngetline() can now retrieve source code for frozen modules. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-131638.)\n\nQueueListener objects now support the context manager protocol. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in gh-132106.)\n\nQueueListener.start now raises a RuntimeError if the listener is already started. (Contributed by Charles Machalow in gh-132106.)\n\nAdded more detailed error messages for domain errors in the module. (Contributed by Charlie Zhao and Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-101410.)\n\nAdd a public command-line for the module, invoked via python -m mimetypes. (Contributed by Oleg Iarygin and Hugo van Kemenade in gh-93096.)\n\nAdd several new MIME types based on RFCs and common usage:\n\nMicrosoft and RFC 8081 MIME types for fonts\n\nEmbedded OpenType: application/vnd.ms-fontobject\n\nOpenType Layout (OTF) font/otf\n\nRFC 9559 MIME types for Matroska audiovisual data container structures\n\naudio with no video: audio/matroska (.mka)\n\nvideo: video/matroska (.mkv)\n\nstereoscopic video: video/matroska-3d (.mk3d)\n\nRFC 1494: CCITT Group 3 (.g3)\n\nRFC 3362: Real-time Facsimile, T.38 (.t38)\n\nRFC 3745: JPEG 2000 (.jp2), extension (.jpx) and compound (.jpm)\n\nRFC 3950: Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended, TIFF-FX (.tfx)\n\nRFC 4047: Flexible Image Transport System (.fits)\n\nRFC 7903: Enhanced Metafile (.emf) and Windows Metafile (.wmf)\n\nOther MIME type additions and changes\n\nRFC 2361: Change type for .avi to video/vnd.avi and for .wav to audio/vnd.wave\n\nRFC 4337: Add MPEG-4 audio/mp4 (.m4a)\n\nRFC 5334: Add Ogg media (.oga, .ogg and .ogx)\n\nRFC 6713: Add gzip application/gzip (.gz)\n\nRFC 9639: Add FLAC audio/flac (.flac)\n\nRFC 9512 application/yaml MIME type for YAML files (.yaml and .yml)\n\nAdd 7z application/x-7z-compressed (.7z)\n\nAdd Android Package application/vnd.android.package-archive (.apk) when not strict\n\nAdd deb application/x-debian-package (.deb)\n\nAdd glTF binary model/gltf-binary (.glb)\n\nAdd glTF JSON/ASCII model/gltf+json (.gltf)\n\nAdd M4V video/x-m4v (.m4v)\n\nAdd PHP application/x-httpd-php (.php)\n\nAdd RAR application/vnd.rar (.rar)\n\nAdd RPM application/x-rpm (.rpm)\n\nAdd STL model/stl (.stl)\n\nAdd Windows Media Video video/x-ms-wmv (.wmv)\n\nDe facto: Add WebM audio/webm (.weba)\n\nECMA-376: Add .docx, .pptx and .xlsx types\n\nOASIS: Add OpenDocument .odg, .odp, .ods and .odt types\n\nW3C: Add EPUB application/epub+zip (.epub)\n\n(Contributed by Sahil Prajapati and Hugo van Kemenade in gh-84852, by Sasha “Nelie” Chernykh and Hugo van Kemenade in gh-132056, and by Hugo van Kemenade in gh-89416, gh-85957, and gh-129965.)\n\nOn Unix platforms other than macOS, ‘forkserver’ is now the default start method (replacing ‘fork’). This change does not affect Windows or macOS, where ‘spawn’ remains the default start method.\n\nIf the threading incompatible fork method is required, you must explicitly request it via a context from get_context() (preferred) or change the default via set_start_method().\n\nSee forkserver restrictions for information and differences with the fork method and how this change may affect existing code with mutable global shared variables and/or shared objects that can not be automatically pickled.\n\n(Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in gh-84559.)\n\nmultiprocessing’s 'forkserver' start method now authenticates its control socket to avoid solely relying on filesystem permissions to restrict what other processes could cause the forkserver to spawn workers and run code. (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith for gh-97514.)\n\nThe multiprocessing proxy objects for list and dict types gain previously overlooked missing methods:\n\nclear() and copy() for proxies of list\n\nfromkeys(), reversed(d), d | {}, {} | d, d |= {'b': 2} for proxies of dict\n\n(Contributed by Roy Hyunjin Han for gh-103134.)\n\nAdd support for shared set objects via SyncManager.set(). The set() in Manager() method is now available. (Contributed by Mingyu Park in gh-129949.)\n\nAdd the interrupt() to multiprocessing.Process objects, which terminates the child process by sending SIGINT. This enables finally clauses to print a stack trace for the terminated process. (Contributed by Artem Pulkin in gh-131913.)\n\nAdd is_none() and is_not_none() as a pair of functions, such that operator.is_none(obj) is equivalent to obj is None and operator.is_not_none(obj) is equivalent to obj is not None. (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger and Nico Mexis in gh-115808.)\n\nAdd the reload_environ() function to update os.environ and os.environb with changes to the environment made by os.putenv(), by os.unsetenv(), or made outside Python in the same process. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-120057.)\n\nAdd the SCHED_DEADLINE and SCHED_NORMAL constants to the os module. (Contributed by James Roy in gh-127688.)\n\nAdd the readinto() function to read into a buffer object from a file descriptor. (Contributed by Cody Maloney in gh-129205.)\n\nThe strict parameter to realpath() accepts a new value, ALLOW_MISSING. If used, errors other than FileNotFoundError will be re-raised; the resulting path can be missing but it will be free of symlinks. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for CVE 2025-4517.)\n\nAdd methods to pathlib.Path to recursively copy or move files and directories:\n\ncopy() copies a file or directory tree to a destination.\n\ncopy_into() copies into a destination directory.\n\nmove() moves a file or directory tree to a destination.\n\nmove_into() moves into a destination directory.\n\n(Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-73991.)\n\nAdd the info attribute, which stores an object implementing the new pathlib.types.PathInfo protocol. The object supports querying the file type and internally caching stat() results. Path objects generated by iterdir() are initialized with file type information gleaned from scanning the parent directory. (Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-125413.)\n\nThe pdb module now supports remote attaching to a running Python process using a new -p PID command-line option:\n\nThis will connect to the Python process with the given PID and allow you to debug it interactively. Notice that due to how the Python interpreter works attaching to a remote process that is blocked in a system call or waiting for I/O will only work once the next bytecode instruction is executed or when the process receives a signal.\n\nThis feature uses PEP 768 and the new sys.remote_exec() function to attach to the remote process and send the PDB commands to it.\n\n(Contributed by Matt Wozniski and Pablo Galindo in gh-131591.)\n\nHardcoded breakpoints (breakpoint() and set_trace()) now reuse the most recent Pdb instance that calls set_trace(), instead of creating a new one each time. As a result, all the instance specific data like display and commands are preserved across hardcoded breakpoints. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-121450.)\n\nAdd a new argument mode to pdb.Pdb. Disable the restart command when pdb is in inline mode. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-123757.)\n\nA confirmation prompt will be shown when the user tries to quit pdb in inline mode. y, Y, <Enter> or EOF will confirm the quit and call sys.exit(), instead of raising bdb.BdbQuit. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-124704.)\n\nInline breakpoints like breakpoint() or pdb.set_trace() will always stop the program at calling frame, ignoring the skip pattern (if any). (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-130493.)\n\n<tab> at the beginning of the line in pdb multi-line input will fill in a 4-space indentation now, instead of inserting a \\t character. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-130471.)\n\nAuto-indent is introduced in pdb multi-line input. It will either keep the indentation of the last line or insert a 4-space indentation when it detects a new code block. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-133350.)\n\n$_asynctask is added to access the current asyncio task if applicable. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-124367.)\n\npdb.set_trace_async() is added to support debugging asyncio coroutines. await statements are supported with this function. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-132576.)\n\nSource code displayed in pdb will be syntax-highlighted. This feature can be controlled using the same methods as the default interactive shell, in addition to the newly added colorize argument of pdb.Pdb. (Contributed by Tian Gao and Łukasz Langa in gh-133355.)\n\nSet the default protocol version on the pickle module to 5. For more details, see pickle protocols.\n\nAdd exception notes for pickle serialization errors that allow identifying the source of the error. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-122213.)\n\nAdd invalidate_caches(), a function to invalidate cached results in the platform module. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-122549.)\n\nAnnotations in help output are now usually displayed in a format closer to that in the original source. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-101552.)\n\nSupport \\z as a synonym for \\Z in regular expressions. It is interpreted unambiguously in many other regular expression engines, unlike \\Z, which has subtly different behavior. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-133306.)\n\n\\B in regular expression now matches the empty input string, meaning that it is now always the opposite of \\b. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-124130.)\n\nImprove and fix support for Bluetooth sockets.\n\nFix support of Bluetooth sockets on NetBSD and DragonFly BSD. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-132429.)\n\nFix support for BTPROTO_HCI on FreeBSD. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-111178.)\n\nAdd support for BTPROTO_SCO on FreeBSD. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-85302.)\n\nAdd support for cid and bdaddr_type in the address for BTPROTO_L2CAP on FreeBSD. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-132429.)\n\nAdd support for channel in the address for BTPROTO_HCI on Linux. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-70145.)\n\nAccept an integer as the address for BTPROTO_HCI on Linux. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-132099.)\n\nReturn cid in getsockname() for BTPROTO_L2CAP. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-132429.)\n\nAdd many new constants. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-132734.)\n\nIndicate through the HAS_PHA Boolean whether the ssl module supports TLSv1.3 post-handshake client authentication (PHA). (Contributed by Will Childs-Klein in gh-128036.)\n\nSupport the float complex and double complex C types in the struct module (formatting characters 'F' and 'D' respectively). (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-121249.)\n\nExpose the following Symbol methods:\n\n(Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-120029.)\n\nThe previously undocumented special function sys.getobjects(), which only exists in specialized builds of Python, may now return objects from other interpreters than the one it’s called in. (Contributed by Eric Snow in gh-125286.)\n\nAdd sys._is_immortal() for determining if an object is immortal. (Contributed by Peter Bierma in gh-128509.)\n\nOn FreeBSD, sys.platform no longer contains the major version number. It is always 'freebsd', instead of 'freebsd13' or 'freebsd14'. (Contributed by Michael Osipov in gh-129393.)\n\nRaise DeprecationWarning for sys._clear_type_cache(). This function was deprecated in Python 3.13 but it didn’t raise a runtime warning.\n\nAdd sys.remote_exec() to implement the new external debugger interface. See PEP 768 for details. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo Salgado, Matt Wozniski, and Ivona Stojanovic in gh-131591.)\n\nAdd the sys._jit namespace, containing utilities for introspecting just-in-time compilation. (Contributed by Brandt Bucher in gh-133231.)\n\nAdd two new monitoring events, BRANCH_LEFT and BRANCH_RIGHT. These replace and deprecate the BRANCH event. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-122548.)\n\nAdd ABIFLAGS key to get_config_vars() on Windows. (Contributed by Xuehai Pan in gh-131799.)\n\ndata_filter() now normalizes symbolic link targets in order to avoid path traversal attacks. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in gh-127987 and CVE 2025-4138.)\n\nextractall() now skips fixing up directory attributes when a directory was removed or replaced by another kind of file. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in gh-127987 and CVE 2024-12718.)\n\nextract() and extractall() now (re-)apply the extraction filter when substituting a link (hard or symbolic) with a copy of another archive member, and when fixing up directory attributes. The former raises a new exception, LinkFallbackError. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for CVE 2025-4330 and CVE 2024-12718.)\n\nextract() and extractall() no longer extract rejected members when errorlevel() is zero. (Contributed by Matt Prodani and Petr Viktorin in gh-112887 and CVE 2025-4435.)\n\nthreading.Thread.start() now sets the operating system thread name to threading.Thread.name. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-59705.)\n\nMake tkinter widget methods after() and after_idle() accept keyword arguments. (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in gh-126899.)\n\nAdd ability to specify a name for tkinter.OptionMenu and tkinter.ttk.OptionMenu. (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in gh-130482.)\n\nAdd context managers for turtle.fill(), turtle.poly(), and turtle.no_animation(). (Contributed by Marie Roald and Yngve Mardal Moe in gh-126350.)\n\ntypes.UnionType is now an alias for typing.Union. See below for more details. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-105499.)\n\nThe types.UnionType and typing.Union types are now aliases for each other, meaning that both old-style unions (created with Union[int, str]) and new-style unions (int | str) now create instances of the same runtime type. This unifies the behavior between the two syntaxes, but leads to some differences in behavior that may affect users who introspect types at runtime:\n\nBoth syntaxes for creating a union now produce the same string representation in repr(). For example, repr(Union[int, str]) is now \"int | str\" instead of \"typing.Union[int, str]\".\n\nUnions created using the old syntax are no longer cached. Previously, running Union[int, str] multiple times would return the same object (Union[int, str] is Union[int, str] would be True), but now it will return two different objects. Use == to compare unions for equality, not is. New-style unions have never been cached this way. This change could increase memory usage for some programs that use a large number of unions created by subscripting typing.Union. However, several factors offset this cost: unions used in annotations are no longer evaluated by default in Python 3.14 because of PEP 649; an instance of types.UnionType is itself much smaller than the object returned by Union[] was on prior Python versions; and removing the cache also saves some space. It is therefore unlikely that this change will cause a significant increase in memory usage for most users.\n\nPreviously, old-style unions were implemented using the private class typing._UnionGenericAlias. This class is no longer needed for the implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like get_origin() and typing.get_args() instead of relying on private implementation details.\n\nIt is now possible to use typing.Union itself in isinstance() checks. For example, isinstance(int | str, typing.Union) will return True; previously this raised TypeError.\n\nThe __args__ attribute of typing.Union objects is no longer writable.\n\nIt is no longer possible to set any attributes on Union objects. This only ever worked for dunder attributes on previous versions, was never documented to work, and was subtly broken in many cases.\n\n(Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-105499.)\n\nTypeAliasType now supports star unpacking.\n\nThe Unicode database has been updated to Unicode 16.0.0.\n\nunittest output is now colored by default. This can be controlled by environment variables. (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in gh-127221.)\n\nunittest discovery supports namespace package as start directory again. It was removed in Python 3.11. (Contributed by Jacob Walls in gh-80958.)\n\nA number of new methods were added in the TestCase class that provide more specialized tests.\n\nassertHasAttr() and assertNotHasAttr() check whether the object has a particular attribute.\n\nassertIsSubclass() and assertNotIsSubclass() check whether the object is a subclass of a particular class, or of one of a tuple of classes.\n\nassertStartsWith(), assertNotStartsWith(), assertEndsWith() and assertNotEndsWith() check whether the Unicode or byte string starts or ends with particular strings.\n\n(Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-71339.)\n\nUpgrade HTTP digest authentication algorithm for urllib.request by supporting SHA-256 digest authentication as specified in RFC 7616. (Contributed by Calvin Bui in gh-128193.)\n\nImprove ergonomics and standards compliance when parsing and emitting file: URLs.\n\nAccept a complete URL when the new require_scheme argument is set to true.\n\nDiscard URL authority if it matches the local hostname.\n\nDiscard URL authority if it resolves to a local IP address when the new resolve_host argument is set to true.\n\nDiscard URL query and fragment components.\n\nRaise URLError if a URL authority isn’t local, except on Windows where we return a UNC path as before.\n\nReturn a complete URL when the new add_scheme argument is set to true.\n\nInclude an empty URL authority when a path begins with a slash. For example, the path /etc/hosts is converted to the URL ///etc/hosts.\n\nOn Windows, drive letters are no longer converted to uppercase, and : characters not following a drive letter no longer cause an OSError exception to be raised.\n\n(Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-125866.)\n\nAdd support for UUID versions 6, 7, and 8 via uuid6(), uuid7(), and uuid8() respectively, as specified in RFC 9562. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-89083.)\n\nNIL and MAX are now available to represent the Nil and Max UUID formats as defined by RFC 9562. (Contributed by Nick Pope in gh-128427.)\n\nAllow generating multiple UUIDs simultaneously on the command-line via python -m uuid --count. (Contributed by Simon Legner in gh-131236.)\n\nNames in the BROWSER environment variable can now refer to already registered browsers for the webbrowser module, instead of always generating a new browser command.\n\nThis makes it possible to set BROWSER to the value of one of the supported browsers on macOS.\n\nAdded ZipInfo._for_archive, a method to resolve suitable defaults for a ZipInfo object as used by ZipFile.writestr. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-123424.)\n\nZipFile.writestr() now respects the SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH environment variable in order to better support reproducible builds. (Contributed by Jiahao Li in gh-91279.)\n\nThe import time for several standard library modules has been improved, including annotationlib, ast, asyncio, base64, cmd, csv, gettext, importlib.util, locale, mimetypes, optparse, pickle, pprint, pstats, shlex, socket, string, subprocess, threading, tomllib, types, and zipfile.\n\n(Contributed by Adam Turner, Bénédikt Tran, Chris Markiewicz, Eli Schwartz, Hugo van Kemenade, Jelle Zijlstra, and others in gh-118761.)\n\nThe interpreter now avoids some reference count modifications internally when it’s safe to do so. This can lead to different values being returned from sys.getrefcount() and Py_REFCNT() compared to previous versions of Python. See below for details.\n\nStandard benchmark results have improved by 10-20% following the implementation of a new per-thread doubly linked list for native tasks, also reducing memory usage. This enables external introspection tools such as python -m asyncio pstree to introspect the call graph of asyncio tasks running in all threads. (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in gh-107803.)\n\nThe module now has first class support for free-threading builds. This enables parallel execution of multiple event loops across different threads, scaling linearly with the number of threads. (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in gh-128002.)\n\nb16decode() is now up to six times faster. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran, Chris Markiewicz, and Adam Turner in gh-118761.)\n\nThe basic debugger now has a sys.monitoring-based backend, which can be selected via the passing 'monitoring' to the Bdb class’s new backend parameter. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-124533.)\n\nThe IS_LINE_JUNK() function is now up to twice as fast. (Contributed by Adam Turner and Semyon Moroz in gh-130167.)\n\nThe new incremental garbage collector means that maximum pause times are reduced by an order of magnitude or more for larger heaps.\n\nBecause of this optimization, the meaning of the results of get_threshold() and set_threshold() have changed, along with get_count() and get_stats().\n\nFor backwards compatibility, get_threshold() continues to return a three-item tuple. The first value is the threshold for young collections, as before; the second value determines the rate at which the old collection is scanned (the default is 10, and higher values mean that the old collection is scanned more slowly). The third value is now meaningless and is always zero.\n\nset_threshold() now ignores any items after the second.\n\nget_count() and get_stats() continue to return the same format of results. The only difference is that instead of the results referring to the young, aging and old generations, the results refer to the young generation and the aging and collecting spaces of the old generation.\n\nIn summary, code that attempted to manipulate the behavior of the cycle GC may not work exactly as intended, but it is very unlikely to be harmful. All other code will work just fine.\n\n(Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-108362.)\n\nOpening and reading files now executes fewer system calls. Reading a small operating system cached file in full is up to 15% faster. (Contributed by Cody Maloney and Victor Stinner in gh-120754 and gh-90102.)\n\nPath.read_bytes now uses unbuffered mode to open files, which is between 9% and 17% faster to read in full. (Contributed by Cody Maloney in gh-120754.)\n\npdb now supports two backends, based on either sys.settrace() or sys.monitoring. Using the pdb CLI or breakpoint() will always use the sys.monitoring backend. Explicitly instantiating pdb.Pdb and its derived classes will use the sys.settrace() backend by default, which is configurable. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-124533.)\n\nOptimize the dedent() function, improving performance by an average of 2.4x, with larger improvements for bigger inputs, and fix a bug with incomplete normalization of blank lines with whitespace characters other than space and tab.\n\nuuid3() and uuid5() are now both roughly 40% faster for 16-byte names and 20% faster for 1024-byte names. Performance for longer names remains unchanged. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-128150.)\n\nuuid4() is now c. 30% faster. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-128150.)\n\nOn Windows, zlib-ng is now used as the implementation of the zlib module in the default binaries. There are no known incompatibilities between zlib-ng and the previously-used zlib implementation. This should result in better performance at all compression levels.\n\nIt is worth noting that zlib.Z_BEST_SPEED (1) may result in significantly less compression than the previous implementation, whilst also significantly reducing the time taken to compress.\n\n(Contributed by Steve Dower in gh-91349.)\n\nRemove the type, choices, and metavar parameters of BooleanOptionalAction. These have been deprecated since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-118805.)\n\nCalling add_argument_group() on an argument group now raises a ValueError. Similarly, add_argument_group() or add_mutually_exclusive_group() on a mutually exclusive group now both raise ValueErrors. This ‘nesting’ was never supported, often failed to work correctly, and was unintentionally exposed through inheritance. This functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11. (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in gh-127186.)\n\nRemove the following classes, which have been deprecated aliases of Constant since Python 3.8 and have emitted deprecation warnings since Python 3.12:\n\nAs a consequence of these removals, user-defined visit_Num, visit_Str, visit_Bytes, visit_NameConstant and visit_Ellipsis methods on custom NodeVisitor subclasses will no longer be called when the NodeVisitor subclass is visiting an AST. Define a visit_Constant method instead.\n\n(Contributed by Alex Waygood in gh-119562.)\n\nRemove the following deprecated properties on ast.Constant, which were present for compatibility with the now-removed AST classes:\n\nUse Constant.value instead.

Coombs and Hugo van Kemenade in gh-93963.)\n\nRemove support for copy, deepcopy, and pickle operations from itertools iterators. These have emitted a DeprecationWarning since Python 3.12. (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in gh-101588.)\n\nRemove support for passing additional keyword arguments to Path. In previous versions, any such arguments are ignored. (Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-74033.)\n\nRemove support for passing additional positional arguments to PurePath.relative_to() and is_relative_to().

(Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-118827.)\n\nRemove the URLopener and FancyURLopener classes from urllib.request, which have been deprecated since Python 3.3.\n\nmyopener.open() can be replaced with urlopen(). myopener.retrieve() can be replaced with urlretrieve(). Customisations to the opener classes can be replaced by passing customized handlers to build_opener(). (Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-84850.)\n\nPassing a complex number as the real or imag argument in the complex() constructor is now deprecated; complex numbers should only be passed as a single positional argument. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-109218.)\n\nPassing the undocumented keyword argument prefix_chars to the add_argument_group() method is now deprecated. (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in gh-125563.)\n\nDeprecated the argparse.FileType type converter.

Use open() instead. (Contributed by Inada Naoki in gh-133036.)\n\nOn non-Windows platforms, setting Structure._pack_ to use a MSVC-compatible default memory layout is now deprecated in favor of setting Structure._layout_ to 'ms', and will be removed in Python 3.19. (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in gh-131747.)\n\nCalling ctypes.POINTER() on a string is now deprecated. Use incomplete types for self-referential structures.

(Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-120743.)\n\npathlib: pathlib.PurePath.as_uri() is now deprecated and scheduled for removal in Python 3.19. Use pathlib.Path.as_uri() instead. (Contributed by Barney Gale in gh-123599.)\n\npdb: The undocumented pdb.Pdb.curframe_locals attribute is now a deprecated read-only property, which will be removed in a future version of Python. The low overhead dynamic frame locals access added in Python 3.13 by PEP 667 means the frame locals cache reference previously stored in this attribute is no longer needed. Derived debuggers should access pdb.Pdb.curframe.f_locals directly in Python 3.13 and later versions. (Contributed by Tian Gao in gh-124369 and gh-125951.)\n\nsymtable: Deprecate symtable.Class.get_methods() due to the lack of interest, scheduled for removal in Python 3.16. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-119698.)\n\ntkinter: The tkinter.Variable methods trace_variable(), trace_vdelete() and trace_vinfo() are now deprecated.

(Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in gh-101866.)\n\nThe undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating NamedTuple classes (for example, Point = NamedTuple(\"Point\", x=int, y=int)) has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.\n\nWhen using the functional syntax of TypedDicts, failing to pass a value to the fields parameter (TD = TypedDict(\"TD\")) or passing None (TD = TypedDict(\"TD\", None)) has been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use class TD(TypedDict): pass or TD = TypedDict(\"TD\", {}) to create a TypedDict with zero field.\n\nThe typing.no_type_check_decorator() decorator function has been deprecated since Python 3.13.

Use not x instead for the logical negation of a Boolean. In the rare case that you need the bitwise inversion of the underlying integer, convert to int explicitly (~int(x)).\n\nCalling the Python implementation of functools.reduce() with function or sequence as keyword arguments has been deprecated since Python 3.14.\n\nSupport for custom logging handlers with the strm argument is deprecated and scheduled for removal in Python 3.16.

For use in type annotations, either use Buffer or a union that explicitly specifies the types your code supports (e.g., bytes | bytearray | memoryview).\n\nByteString was originally intended to be an abstract class that would serve as a supertype of both bytes and bytearray. However, since the ABC never had any methods, knowing that an object was an instance of ByteString never actually told you anything useful about the object. Other common buffer types such as memoryview were also never understood as subtypes of ByteString (either at runtime or by static type checkers).\n\nSee PEP 688 for more details. (Contributed by Shantanu Jain in gh-91896.)\n\nBefore Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private class typing._UnionGenericAlias. This class is no longer needed for the implementation, but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python 3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like typing.get_origin() and typing.get_args() instead of relying on private implementation details.\n\ntyping.ByteString, deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.\n\nUse isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Buffer) to test if obj implements the buffer protocol at runtime.

It allows confusing and ambiguous expressions like [0x1for x in y] (which can be interpreted as [0x1 for x in y] or [0x1f or x in y]). A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is immediately followed by one of keywords and, else, for, if, in, is and or. In a future release it will be changed to a syntax error.

(Contributed by Matt Page in gh-130704.)\n\nAdd the LOAD_SMALL_INT opcode, which pushes a small integer equal to the oparg to the stack. The RETURN_CONST opcode is removed as it is no longer used. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-125837.)\n\nAdd the new LOAD_SPECIAL instruction. Generate code for with and async with statements using the new instruction. Removed the BEFORE_WITH and BEFORE_ASYNC_WITH instructions. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-120507.)\n\nAdd the POP_ITER opcode to support ‘virtual’ iterators. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-132554.)\n\nAdd the ANNOTATIONS_PLACEHOLDER pseudo instruction to support partially executed module-level annotations with deferred evaluation of annotations. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-130907.)\n\nAdd the BINARY_OP_EXTEND pseudo instruction, which executes a pair of functions (guard and specialization functions) accessed from the inline cache. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in gh-100239.)\n\nAdd three specializations for CALL_KW; CALL_KW_PY for calls to Python functions, CALL_KW_BOUND_METHOD for calls to bound methods, and CALL_KW_NON_PY for all other calls. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-118093.)\n\nAdd the JUMP_IF_TRUE and JUMP_IF_FALSE pseudo instructions, conditional jumps which do not impact the stack.

(Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-125837.)\n\nAdd the NOT_TAKEN pseudo instruction, used by sys.monitoring to record branch events (such as BRANCH_LEFT). (Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-122548.)\n\nAdd a PyInitConfig C API to configure the Python initialization without relying on C structures and the ability to make ABI-compatible changes in the future.\n\nComplete the PEP 587 PyConfig C API by adding PyInitConfig_AddModule() which can be used to add a built-in extension module; a feature previously referred to as the “inittab”.\n\nAdd PyConfig_Get() and PyConfig_Set() functions to get and set the current runtime configuration.\n\nPEP 587 ‘Python Initialization Configuration’ unified all the ways to configure Python’s initialization. This PEP also unifies the configuration of Python’s preinitialization and initialization in a single API. Moreover, this PEP only provides a single choice to embed Python, instead of having two ‘Python’ and ‘Isolated’ choices (PEP 587), to further simplify the API.\n\nThe lower level PEP 587 PyConfig API remains available for use cases with an intentionally higher level of coupling to CPython implementation details (such as emulating the full functionality of CPython’s CLI, including its configuration mechanisms).\n\n(Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-107954.)\n\nAdd Py_PACK_VERSION() and Py_PACK_FULL_VERSION(), two new macros for bit-packing Python version numbers.

This works similarly to the standard C fopen() function, instead accepting a Python object for the path parameter and setting an exception on error. The corresponding new Py_fclose() function should be used to close a file. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-127350.)\n\nAdd Py_HashBuffer() to compute and return the hash value of a buffer. (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou and Victor Stinner in gh-122854.)\n\nAdd PyImport_ImportModuleAttr() and PyImport_ImportModuleAttrString() helper functions to import a module and get an attribute of the module.

(Contributed by Mark Shannon in gh-122548.)\n\nAdd PyType_Freeze() function to make a type immutable. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-121654.)\n\nAdd PyType_GetBaseByToken() and Py_tp_token slot for easier superclass identification, which attempts to resolve the type checking issue mentioned in PEP 630. (Contributed in gh-124153.)\n\nAdd a new PyUnicode_Equal() function to test if two strings are equal. The function is also added to the Limited C API. (Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-124502.)\n\nAdd a new PyUnicodeWriter API to create a Python str object, with the following functions:\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_Create()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_DecodeUTF8Stateful()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_Discard()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_Finish()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_Format()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteASCII()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteRepr()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteUCS4()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8()\n\nPyUnicodeWriter_WriteWideChar()\n\n(Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-119182.)\n\nThe k and K formats in PyArg_ParseTuple() and similar functions now use __index__() if available, like all other integer formats.

(Contributed by Pablo Galindo in bpo-45325.)\n\nAdd PyUnstable_IsImmortal() for determining if an object is immortal, for debugging purposes. (Contributed by Peter Bierma in gh-128509.)\n\nAdd PyUnstable_Object_EnableDeferredRefcount() for enabling deferred reference counting, as outlined in PEP 703.\n\nAdd PyUnstable_Object_IsUniquelyReferenced() as a replacement for Py_REFCNT(op) == 1 on free threaded builds.

(Contributed by Victor Stinner in gh-129033.)\n\nRemove the undocumented APIs Py_C_RECURSION_LIMIT and PyThreadState.c_recursion_remaining. These were added in 3.13 and have been removed without deprecation. Use Py_EnterRecursiveCall() to guard against runaway recursion in C code. (Removed by Petr Viktorin in gh-133079, see also gh-130396.)\n\nThe Py_HUGE_VAL macro is now soft deprecated. Use Py_INFINITY instead.

(Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in gh-119613.)\n\nNon-tuple sequences are now deprecated as argument for the (items) format unit in PyArg_ParseTuple() and other argument parsing functions if items contains format units which store a borrowed buffer or a borrowed reference. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-50333.)\n\nThe _PyMonitoring_FireBranchEvent function is now deprecated and should be replaced with calls to PyMonitoring_FireBranchLeftEvent() and PyMonitoring_FireBranchRightEvent().\n\nThe previously undocumented function PySequence_In() is now soft deprecated.

As a part of this effort, more than 25 bugs in Emscripten libc were fixed. Emscripten now includes support for ctypes, termios, and fcntl, as well as experimental support for the new default interactive shell. (Contributed by R. Hood Chatham in gh-127146, gh-127683, and gh-136931.)\n\nOfficial Android binary releases are now provided on python.org.\n\nGNU Autoconf 2.72 is now required to generate configure. (Contributed by Erlend Aasland in gh-115765.)\n\nwasm32-unknown-emscripten is now a PEP 11 tier 3 platform. (Contributed by R. Hood Chatham in gh-127146, gh-127683, and gh-136931.)\n\n#pragma-based linking with python3*.lib can now be switched off with Py_NO_LINK_LIB. (Contributed by Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin in gh-82909.)\n\nCPython now enables a set of recommended compiler options by default for improved security. Use the --disable-safety configure option to disable them, or the --enable-slower-safety option for a larger set of compiler options, albeit with a performance cost.\n\nThe WITH_FREELISTS macro and --without-freelists configure option have been removed.\n\nThe new configure option --with-tail-call-interp may be used to enable the experimental tail call interpreter. See A new type of interpreter for further details.\n\nTo disable the new remote debugging support, use the --without-remote-debug configure option. This may be useful for security reasons.\n\niOS and macOS apps can now be configured to redirect stdout and stderr content to the system log. (Contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in gh-127592.)\n\nThe iOS testbed is now able to stream test output while the test is running. The testbed can also be used to run the test suite of projects other than CPython itself. (Contributed by Russell Keith-Magee in gh-127592.)\n\nInstallations of Python now contain a new file, build-details.json. This is a static JSON document containing build details for CPython, to allow for introspection without needing to run code. This is helpful for use-cases such as Python launchers, cross-compilation, and so on.\n\nbuild-details.json must be installed in the platform-independent standard library directory. This corresponds to the ‘stdlib’ sysconfig installation path, which can be found by running sysconfig.get_path('stdlib').\n\nPEP 739 – build-details.json 1.0 – a static description file for Python build details\n\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures will not be provided for releases of Python 3.14 or future versions. To verify CPython artifacts, users must use Sigstore verification materials. Releases have been signed using Sigstore since Python 3.11.\n\nThis change in release process was specified in PEP 761.\n\nThe free-threaded build of Python is now supported and no longer experimental. This is the start of phase II where free-threaded Python is officially supported but still optional.\n\nThe free-threading team are confident that the project is on the right path, and appreciate the continued dedication from everyone working to make free-threading ready for broader adoption across the Python community.\n\nWith these recommendations and the acceptance of this PEP, the Python developer community should broadly advertise that free-threading is a supported Python build option now and into the future, and that it will not be removed without a proper deprecation schedule.\n\nAny decision to transition to phase III, with free-threading as the default or sole build of Python is still undecided, and dependent on many factors both within CPython itself and the community. This decision is for the future.\n\nThe official macOS and Windows release binaries now include an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Although it is not recommended for production use, it can be tested by setting PYTHON_JIT=1 as an environment variable. Downstream source builds and redistributors can use the --enable-experimental-jit=yes-off configuration option for similar behavior.\n\nThe JIT is at an early stage and still in active development. As such, the typical performance impact of enabling it can range from 10% slower to 20% faster, depending on workload. To aid in testing and evaluation, a set of introspection functions has been provided in the sys._jit namespace. sys._jit.is_available() can be used to determine if the current executable supports JIT compilation, while sys._jit.is_enabled() can be used to tell if JIT compilation has been enabled for the current process.\n\nCurrently, the most significant missing functionality is that native debuggers and profilers like gdb and perf are unable to unwind through JIT frames (Python debuggers and profilers, like pdb or profile, continue to work without modification). Free-threaded builds do not support JIT compilation.\n\nPlease report any bugs or major performance regressions that you encounter!\n\nThis section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes that may require changes to your code.\n\nOn Unix platforms other than macOS, forkserver is now the default start method for multiprocessing and ProcessPoolExecutor, instead of fork.\n\nSee (1) and (2) for details.\n\nIf you encounter NameErrors or pickling errors coming out of multiprocessing or concurrent.futures, see the forkserver restrictions.\n\nThis change does not affect Windows or macOS, where ‘spawn’ remains the default start method.\n\nfunctools.partial is now a method descriptor. Wrap it in staticmethod() if you want to preserve the old behavior. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Dominykas Grigonis in gh-121027.)\n\nThe garbage collector is now incremental, which means that the behavior of gc.collect() changes slightly:\n\ngc.collect(1): Performs an increment of garbage collection, rather than collecting generation 1.\n\nOther calls to gc.collect() are unchanged.\n\nThe locale.nl_langinfo() function now temporarily sets the LC_CTYPE locale in some cases. This temporary change affects other threads. (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in gh-69998.)\n\ntypes.UnionType is now an alias for typing.Union, causing changes in some behaviors. See above for more details. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in gh-105499.)\n\nThe runtime behavior of annotations has changed in various ways; see above for details. While most code that interacts with annotations should continue to work, some undocumented details may behave differently.\n\nAs part of making the mimetypes CLI public, it now exits with 1 on failure instead of 0 and 2 on incorrect command-line parameters instead of 1. Error messages are now printed to stderr.\n\nThe \\B pattern in regular expression now matches the empty string when given as the entire pattern, which may cause behavioural changes.\n\nOn FreeBSD, sys.platform no longer contains the major version number.\n\nThis section contains guidance on changes that may be needed to annotations or Python code that interacts with or introspects annotations, due to the changes related to deferred evaluation of annotations.\n\nIn the majority of cases, working code from older versions of Python will not require any changes.\n\nIf you define annotations in your code (for example, for use with a static type checker), then this change probably does not affect you: you can keep writing annotations the same way you did with previous versions of Python.\n\nYou will likely be able to remove quoted strings in annotations, which are frequently used for forward references. Similarly, if you use from __future__ import annotations to avoid having to write strings in annotations, you may well be able to remove that import once you support only Python 3.14 and newer. However, if you rely on third-party libraries that read annotations, those libraries may need changes to support unquoted annotations before they work as expected.\n\nIf your code reads the __annotations__ attribute on objects, you may want to make changes in order to support code that relies on deferred evaluation of annotations. For example, you may want to use annotationlib.get_annotations() with the FORWARDREF format, as the dataclasses module now does.\n\nThe external typing_extensions package provides partial backports of some of the functionality of the annotationlib module, such as the Format enum and the get_annotations() function. These can be used to write cross-version code that takes advantage of the new behavior in Python 3.14.\n\nThe changes in Python 3.14 are designed to rework how __annotations__ works at runtime while minimizing breakage to code that contains annotations in source code and to code that reads __annotations__. However, if you rely on undocumented details of the annotation behavior or on private functions in the standard library, there are many ways in which your code may not work in Python 3.14. To safeguard your code against future changes, only use the documented functionality of the annotationlib module.\n\nIn particular, do not read annotations directly from the namespace dictionary attribute of type objects. Use annotationlib.get_annotate_from_class_namespace() during class construction and annotationlib.get_annotations() afterwards.\n\nIn previous releases, it was sometimes possible to access class annotations from an instance of an annotated class. This behavior was undocumented and accidental, and will no longer work in Python 3.14.\n\nIn Python 3.7, PEP 563 introduced the from __future__ import annotations future statement, which turns all annotations into strings.\n\nHowever, this statement is now deprecated and it is expected to be removed in a future version of Python. This removal will not happen until after Python 3.13 reaches its end of life in 2029, being the last version of Python without support for deferred evaluation of annotations.\n\nIn Python 3.14, the behavior of code using from __future__ import annotations is unchanged.\n\nPy_Finalize() now deletes all interned strings. This is backwards incompatible to any C extension that holds onto an interned string after a call to Py_Finalize() and is then reused after a call to Py_Initialize(). Any issues arising from this behavior will normally result in crashes during the execution of the subsequent call to Py_Initialize() from accessing uninitialized memory. To fix, use an address sanitizer to identify any use-after-free coming from an interned string and deallocate it during module shutdown. (Contributed by Eddie Elizondo in gh-113601.)\n\nThe Unicode Exception Objects C API now raises a TypeError if its exception argument is not a UnicodeError object. (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in gh-127691.)\n\nThe interpreter internally avoids some reference count modifications when loading objects onto the operands stack by borrowing references when possible. This can lead to smaller reference count values compared to previous Python versions. C API extensions that checked Py_REFCNT() of 1 to determine if an function argument is not referenced by any other code should instead use PyUnstable_Object_IsUniqueReferencedTemporary() as a safer replacement.\n\nPrivate functions promoted to public C APIs:\n\n_PyBytes_Join(): PyBytes_Join()\n\n_PyLong_IsNegative(): PyLong_IsNegative()\n\n_PyLong_IsPositive(): PyLong_IsPositive()\n\n_PyLong_IsZero(): PyLong_IsZero()\n\n_PyLong_Sign(): PyLong_GetSign()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_Dealloc(): PyUnicodeWriter_Discard()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_Finish(): PyUnicodeWriter_Finish()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_Init(): use PyUnicodeWriter_Create()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_Prepare(): (no replacement)\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_PrepareKind(): (no replacement)\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar(): PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr(): PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr()\n\n_PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring(): PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring()\n\n_PyUnicode_EQ(): PyUnicode_Equal()\n\n_PyUnicode_Equal(): PyUnicode_Equal()\n\n_Py_GetConfig(): PyConfig_Get() and PyConfig_GetInt()\n\n_Py_HashBytes(): Py_HashBuffer()\n\n_Py_fopen_obj(): Py_fopen()\n\nPyMutex_IsLocked() : PyMutex_IsLocked()\n\nThe pythoncapi-compat project can be used to get most of these new functions on Python 3.13 and older.\n\nAdd PyUnstable_ThreadState_SetStackProtection() and PyUnstable_ThreadState_ResetStackProtection() functions to set the stack protection base address and stack protection size of a Python thread state.
