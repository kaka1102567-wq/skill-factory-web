## Three Main Targeting Types

### 1. Detailed Targeting (Core Audiences)

**Age & Gender**: From user signup data, generally reliable.

**Demographics**: Education level, parental status, work details. Sourced from profile info, ad clicks, page engagement, device data, Meta activities. Income data averaged by zip code (US only).

**Interests**: Based on content engagement history, liked pages, event interactions. Search for specific interests beyond dropdown menus.

**Behaviors**: Purchasing history, device type, intent signals. Ranges from "new business users" to gaming activities to travel behaviors.

### 2. Lookalike Audiences

Facebook builds audience of users whose behaviors "look like" your source audience.

- Provide custom audience source (minimum 100 users in one country)
- Recommended: 1,000-5,000 users in source
- Percentage options: 1% (most similar) to higher %
- Higher % = larger but less similar audience

### 3. Meta Advantage+ Audiences

Machine learning handles targeting automatically using conversion data, pixel info, past ad interactions.

- Optional audience suggestions available
- Facebook may expand beyond suggestions if better patterns found
- Requires giving up some targeting control

## Strategy Recommendations

- Test different targeting types across ad sets
- Maintain control in some campaigns, allow automation in others
- Analyze performance data to determine what works best
- Remain open to testing new approaches
