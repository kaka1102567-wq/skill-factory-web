Source: https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2022/09/26/how-to-optimize-facebook-ads

## 1. Perfect Account Structure
Organize campaigns by objective, not audience. One campaign per objective, ad sets by different audiences.

## 2. Meta Pixel with Google Tag Manager
Use GTM for pixel installation. Set up Conversions API alongside Meta Pixel for complete visibility.

## 3. Consolidate Conversions
Group similar conversion events. Comply with Aggregated Event Measurement for iOS 14+ opt-out users.

## 4. Choose Right Bidding Strategy
- Lead generation: Cost per result
- Unclear conversion costs: Highest volume
- E-commerce: Cost per result, ROAS goal, or highest value

## 5. Optimize for Objective
- Awareness: Use reach (default)
- Traffic: Switch to landing page views
- Engagement: Select ThruPlay
- Leads/Sales: Use conversions (default)

## 6. Fast Takeoff Method
Temporarily increase budget until 10,000 impressions, then reduce. Generates data faster for optimization.

## 7. Target Parallel Interests
Target complementary interests (e.g., "children's clothing" for toy ads). Think beyond direct product interests.

## 8. Target Influencers' Audiences
Research pages your followers engage with. Target those page likers through detailed targeting.

## 9. Automated Rules
Pause underperforming ads, adjust budgets based on thresholds, modify bids automatically. Don't set and forget.

## 10. Full-Funnel Strategy
Create remarketing campaigns targeting earlier funnel users. Guide them toward conversion through sequential experiences.
