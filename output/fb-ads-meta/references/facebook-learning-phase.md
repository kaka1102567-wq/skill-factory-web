## What It Is

Period where Meta's machine learning tests different ad delivery combinations to optimize performance. Performance is worse during learning phase with inconsistent daily results and higher costs per conversion.

## When It Triggers

1. **New Creation**: Any fresh campaign, ad set, or creative
2. **Significant Edits** (changes exceeding ~20%):
   - Budget or bid adjustments
   - Bidding strategy changes
   - Creative modifications (text or images)
   - Audience targeting adjustments
   - Placement changes
   - Conversion objective modifications

## Exit Requirements

Need 50 or more conversion events in a seven-day period to exit. If unable to achieve this, you get "learning limited" status.

## Best Practices to Minimize Duration

- Limit significant changes or batch them together
- Maintain audiences large enough for conversion goals
- Ensure sufficient budget to reach objectives
- Avoid pausing campaigns longer than 7 days
- Consolidate budgets where possible
- Minimize over-segmentation

Key insight: You cannot avoid learning phase entirely - focus on minimizing time spent in it.
