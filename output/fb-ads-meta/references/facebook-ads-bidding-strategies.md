Total value = Bid + Estimated action rates + Ad quality

## The 5 Bidding Strategies

### Spend-Based Strategies

**1. Highest Volume**
- Maximizes conversions within budget
- Best when lacking specific CPA targets
- CPA fluctuates with competition
- Similar to Google Ads Maximize Clicks

**2. Highest Value**
- Focuses on high-value conversions over volume
- Requires conversion tracking + assigned values
- Ideal for ecommerce with premium items
- Maximizes ROAS

### Goal-Based Strategies

**3. Cost Per Result**
- Maintains average CPA you specify
- Best when you know break-even CPA
- Setting targets too low extends learning phase

**4. ROAS Goal**
- Targets specific return on ad spend %
- Popular for revenue-generating conversions
- Won't necessarily spend full budget
- Requires conversion value assignments

### Manual Strategy

**5. Bid Cap**
- You set maximum auction bids
- Requires strong understanding of costs
- Manual control, gaining less favor

## By Business Type

- Lead Generation: Use highest volume or cost per result
- E-commerce: Use cost per result, ROAS goal, or highest value

## Key Takeaway

Most clients operate profitably on highest volume spend-based bidding. Optimal choice depends on business model, not complexity.
