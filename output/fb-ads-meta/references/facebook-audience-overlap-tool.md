## What It Is

Identifies when multiple audiences share the same users. Overlapping audiences across ad sets drain budget by serving ads to same people multiple times.

## How to Access

1. Navigate to Facebook Ads Audience Manager
2. Select 2+ audiences by checking boxes
3. Click three-dot menu at top
4. Choose "show audience overlap"

## Reading the Report

Venn diagram showing: selected audience size, comparison audience with overlap %, overlapping user count.

## 3 Ways to Avoid Overspending

1. **Skip smaller audience**: If substantial overlap, eliminate one entirely
2. **Combine in one ad set**: Target both together from single budget pool
3. **Use exclusions**: Target larger audience while excluding smaller one, then target smaller separately

## Limitations

- Only works with audiences of 10,000+ Accounts Center accounts
- Won't display overlaps smaller than 1,000 users (privacy)
- Affects all audience types: lookalikes, customer lists, saved audiences
