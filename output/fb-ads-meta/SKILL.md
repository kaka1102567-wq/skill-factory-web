## Expert Tips

### Campaign Structure
- Organize campaigns by objective, not audience
- One campaign per objective, ad sets by different audiences
- Campaign hierarchy: Campaign → Ad Set → Ad

### Targeting Best Practices
- Start with Advantage+ or broad targeting for new accounts
- Use 1-2 interests per ad set (don't over-target)
- Lookalike audiences need minimum 1,000 source users
- Check audience overlap to avoid budget waste

### Budget & Bidding
- Start $5-10/day minimum per ad set
- Use Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) for 3+ ad sets
- Most businesses profit on highest volume bidding
- Lead gen: cost per result; E-commerce: ROAS goal

### Learning Phase
- Need 50+ conversions in 7 days to exit
- Don't edit campaigns during learning (resets it)
- Batch changes together to minimize resets
- Fast takeoff: temporarily boost budget to 10K impressions

### Creative Trends 2025
- Video priority: 86% want more brand videos
- Best length: 16-20 seconds
- Short-form: Facebook beats TikTok for US consumption
- UGC-style content outperforms polished studio content

### Key Benchmarks 2024
- Traffic avg CPC: $0.77, CTR: 1.57%
- Leads avg CPC: $1.88, CVR: 8.78%, CPL: $21.98
